# React-Portfolio-2

## Introduction

Welcome to my React Profile!  This single page application was built using react and bootstrap.  It showcases a page listing my skills learned as a web developer during the course of the DU Coding Bootcamp, a brief bio, a portfolio page demonstrating the apps I have either single-handedly built or collaborated on, a link to my resume, and contact information.

# Skills learned

On the 'J.Z. Davidson' page, you will find a picture of me standing in front of Eleven Mile Reservoir, as I am an avid fisherman.  Below the picture you will see a list of skills aquired while taking the DU Coding Bootcamp.

# About Me

In the 'About Me' section, you'll see a picture of me from JAX restaurant (excellent seafood) and a short bio basically just giving a brief background of who I am.

# Portfolio

In the 'Portfolio' page, you will find several different projects that I have worked on, either by myself or with other people, while attending the DU Coding Boot Camp.  Each project displays a screenshot of what part of the app looks like, the name of the app, the github link to the repo, and a link to the deployed app.

# Resume 

On the 'Resume' page, the user can click on the button titled "Resume" to be redirected to my resume as it is stored on Google Drive.  Another button, "Return to Home Page," is displayed under the "Resume" button, to return the user back to the home page once they have finished reviewing my resume.

# Contact

The 'Contact' page provides fields where a user can enter their name, e-mail address (which is never shared with anybody), and leave me a comment, question, or concern!
